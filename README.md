Stages WT

The project is on the Master Branch

I have had to do a Node.js REST API project
My project consist of an authentification form and a to do list
In the stage 2 i have had only some html, css and js
Now, in the stage 3, i have fully implemented the Authentification form fully
-i have created the database with MngoDB
-the login, register and dashboard
-the dashboard is the page that we are being redirected after we login
-the registretion form is able to verify if the passwords don't match, if the email introduced already exists and if the password contains at least 6 characters
